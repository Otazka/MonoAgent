- Run tests locally: `python -m pytest -v`.
- Follow the code style (see CI) â€“ run `flake8`, `black`, and `isort`.
- Ensure tests pass and add tests for new features where reasonable.

## Proposing changes
- Open an issue to discuss large changes.
- Keep PRs focused and small where possible.
- Include docs updates for user-facing changes.

## Commit messages
- Use conventional style where possible: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`.

## Security

- Report security issues privately via email in README.
